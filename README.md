### Setup

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/makersacademy/pairing_exercises.git
$ cd pairing_exercises
$ bundle install
```

### Instructions

1. Decide in your pairs when to rotate driver and navigator:
   - by setting a 15 min timer
   - by passing a test
 
2. Focus on passing 1 test at a time - discuss your approach and implement `Scrabble#score`!

3. We'll have a short ten minute reflection halfway through. 
   - What's going well?
   - what can you improve on?

4. We'll reflect on the exercise at the end


#### Task

Given a word, compute the scrabble score for that word.

##### Letter Values

You'll need these:

| Letter                        | Value  |
| ----                          |  ----  |
| A, E, I, O, U, L, N, R, S, T  |     1  | 
| D, G                          |     2  |
| B, C, M, P                    |     3  |
| F, H, V, W, Y                 |     4  |
| K                             |     5  |
| J, X                          |     8  |
| Q, Z                          |     10 |

Examples
"cabbage" should be scored as worth 14 points:

- 3 points for C
- 1 point for A, twice
- 3 points for B, twice
- 2 points for G
- 1 point for E

And to total:

3 + 2*1 + 2*3 + 2 + 1

= 3 + 2 + 6 + 3

= 5 + 9

= 14
